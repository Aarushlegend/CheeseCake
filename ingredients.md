1) Block cream cheese
Four 8-ounce blocks of full-fat cream cheese are the base of this cheesecake. That’s 2 pounds. Make sure you’re buying the blocks of cream cheese and not cream cheese spread.

2) Sugar
1 cup. Not that much considering how many mouths you can feed with this dessert. Over-sweetened cheesecake is hardly cheesecake anymore. 
    
3) Sour cream
1 cup.

4) A little flavor
1 teaspoon of pure vanilla extract and 2 of lemon juice.   
    
5) Eggs
3 eggs are the final ingredient. You’ll beat the eggs in last, one at a time, until they are *just* incorporated.

6) Graham cracker crumbs
You can either process graham crackers or buy them like crumbs from your nearest supermarket.
